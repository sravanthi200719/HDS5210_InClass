        "This assignment consisted of both easy and difficult portions. Creating the JSON structure was simple, as it only required organizing my personal information and grades in a logical order. The more difficult element was building Python code to interact with the JSON data, particularly when it came to looping through the grades and extracting the necessary information. It was difficult to handle ungraded assignments while also ensuring that the system did not break owing to missing data. What piqued my interest was how programming can convert raw data into a legible and relevant summary, demonstrating the use of these skills in real-world applications. Overall, I enjoyed the creative part of crafting the summary, and I appreciated how this task integrated what we had studied about data structures to practical use."
